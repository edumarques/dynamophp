**DynamoPHP** is a strongly-typed, attribute-based Object Data Mapper for Amazon DynamoDB. It is built on top of modern
PHP, which enable definition of entities using PHP 8+ attributes and interaction with DynamoDB using a clean, expressive
API.

Inspired by data mappers like [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org) and modeled after patterns in libraries such
as [TypeDORM](https://github.com/typedorm/typedorm).

## Features

- **Entity Management:** automatically handles CRUD operations.
- **Index Support:** work with Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) and Local Secondary Indexes (LSI).
- **Query Builder:** build complex queries with minimal boilerplate.

## Installation

You can install **DynamoPHP** via Composer:

```shell
composer require edumarques/dynamophp
